# Roblox BanAPI Bypass
a simple and shitty batch script to automate bypassing roblox banapi.

only works if you have ethernet, if you have "ethernet 2" showing up on tmac and its on top, this script won't work, try uninstalling the related software like virtualbox.
you can change it from Ethernet to a device you use like "WiFi" by going to the "basicallymacchanger" label.
this script will still install tmac despite already having it. it will install to the current directory to "TMfunny" folder.
