# Roblox BanAPI Bypass
a simple and shitty batch script to automate bypassing roblox banapi.

Only works if you have ethernet, if you have "ethernet 2" This script won't work, try uninstalling the related software like virtualbox.
you can change it from Ethernet to a device you use like "WiFi" by going to the "basicallymacchanger" label.
this script will still install tmac despite already having it. it will install to the current directory to "TMfunny" folder.


my hope is that by releasing this to github, someone who's actually competent will take the code and make something that is better so i can use theirs instead of this
